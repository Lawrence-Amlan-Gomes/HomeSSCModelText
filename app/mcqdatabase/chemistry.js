    Concept of Chemistry Science is a branch called Natural Science. Over the ages, through observation or experimentation, 
    understanding or explaining any natural topic or predicting about it is the work of natural science. 
    Chemistry is a branch of natural science where the structure of matter, properties of matter, 
    and changes in matter are discussed. For example: Banana is a substance, inside the banana there 
    is carbon. Here, how the carbon atoms are inside the banana and how they work combined with all 
    other elements of the bananaâ€”this is what chemistry discusses, focusing on carbon and so on. Whether 
    it's matter or life or anything else, everything is a subject of discussion in chemistry. Natural 
    science has branches like Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Soil Science, etc. 
    The metal coin you use is a gift of chemistry. There is a beautiful history about when, where, 
    and how chemistry expanded in human history. For example, it can be said that at one time we had to 
    make objects like stones and clay pots. People of that era started making whatever they could with 
    what was at hand. But they didn't have to follow the exact rules of science like now. From ancient Egypt, 
    chemistry has progressed towards complexity and change over time, and knowledge of chemistry has helped 
    people deeply to create new things. A lot has changed with time. At one time, humanity began to learn how 
    to alloy metals and transform them into metals. He named it Atom (meaning indivisible). Around the same time,
     some Indian philosophers expressed almost the same idea as Democritus. But those ideas had no experimental
      basis. Aristotle opposed this idea. Then philosophers like Aristotle thought that all matter is made of 
      earth, fire, water, and air. As a result, people did not accept it until a few days in the eighteenth 
      century. Arab Muslim philosophers tried to make gold from metals like copper, tin, lead. They also 
      tried to make a substance that, if eaten, would increase a person's age a lot or cure all diseases 
      and weaknesses. Many of them were the worst activities in chemistry. As a result, since they did not 
      get reality, they made many substances according to the model of making gold with various substances
       and left those experiments written. Basically, this was the first physics of chemistry's history. 
       Among the research phases of chemistry, the practice of chemistry was called Alchemy and in it the 
       first Alchemist of chemistry. In alchemy came another type of knowledge-research phase. The Greek 
       word alchemy came from the Arabic word kinmi. From kinmi came the word Chemi, which was used in 
       ancient times. In the nineteenth century, the first modern chemistry educator reviewed various 
       characteristics of chemistry to understand their research, which naturally gave us in our time. 
       Slowly, all the people who could do the right work, from the scientific perspective among the 
       scientists, they were doing better work. For this, they started providing more knowledge to 
       scientists. From that time, people became more thoughtful towards science and technology. 
       In the eighteenth century in Europe, many more scientists in chemistry, physics, Robert Boyle, 
       Sir Francis Bacon, John Dalton, Henry Cavendish and more individuals through modern science and
        more technologists through chemistry and other scientific subjects were conceived through 
        experimental means. Raw mango has various types of oil acids like: citric acid, malic acid, 
        etc. present, so raw mango is sour. But when the mango ripens, chemical changes occur in 
        these acids creating natural and fructose. So ripe mango is sweet.
