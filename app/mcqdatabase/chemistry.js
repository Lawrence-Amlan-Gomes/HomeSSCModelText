    chapter1: `Chemistry is a branch of natural science that studies the structure, properties, and changes of matter. For example, in a banana, carbon atoms interact with other elements to form its composition. History: Ancient alchemy evolved into modern chemistry. Key figures: Robert Boyle, John Dalton. Early ideas: Atoms as indivisible particles (Democritus). Everyday examples: Raw mango is sour due to citric and malic acids; ripening converts them to sugars like fructose, making it sweet. Hydrocarbons in kerosene burn to produce CO2, water, heat, and light. Stomach acidity: Excess HCl causes issues; antacids (Al(OH)3 + Mg(OH)2) neutralize it. Role in life: Photosynthesis is a chemical reaction: CO2 + H2O → glucose + O2. All living bodies are chemical factories with constant reactions. Applications: Fertilizers (N, P, K), paper from cellulose, soaps, toothpaste—all chemistry products. Excessive pesticides pollute the environment. Lab safety: Use PPE; recognize GHS symbols for explosives, toxics, corrosives, etc. (e.g., explosive: TNT; toxic: CO).`,
