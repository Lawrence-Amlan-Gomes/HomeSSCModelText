    Concept of Chemistry Science is a branch called Natural Science. Over the ages, through observation or experimentation, 
    understanding or explaining any natural topic or predicting about it is the work of natural science. 
    Chemistry is a branch of natural science where the structure of matter, properties of matter, 
    and changes in matter are discussed. For example: Banana is a substance, inside the banana there 
    is carbon. Here, how the carbon atoms are inside the banana and how they work combined with all 
    other elements of the banana—this is what chemistry discusses, focusing on carbon and so on. Whether 
    it's matter or life or anything else, everything is a subject of discussion in chemistry. Natural 
    science has branches like Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Soil Science, etc. 
    The metal coin you use is a gift of chemistry. There is a beautiful history about when, where, 
    and how chemistry expanded in human history. For example, it can be said that at one time we had to 
    make objects like stones and clay pots. People of that era started making whatever they could with 
    what was at hand. But they didn't have to follow the exact rules of science like now. From ancient Egypt, 
    chemistry has progressed towards complexity and change over time, and knowledge of chemistry has helped 
    people deeply to create new things. A lot has changed with time. At one time, humanity began to learn how 
    to alloy metals and transform them into metals. He named it Atom (meaning indivisible). Around the same time,
     some Indian philosophers expressed almost the same idea as Democritus. But those ideas had no experimental
      basis. Aristotle opposed this idea. Then philosophers like Aristotle thought that all matter is made of 
      earth, fire, water, and air. As a result, people did not accept it until a few days in the eighteenth 
      century. Arab Muslim philosophers tried to make gold from metals like copper, tin, lead. They also 
      tried to make a substance that, if eaten, would increase a person's age a lot or cure all diseases 
      and weaknesses. Many of them were the worst activities in chemistry. As a result, since they did not 
      get reality, they made many substances according to the model of making gold with various substances
       and left those experiments written. Basically, this was the first physics of chemistry's history. 
       Among the research phases of chemistry, the practice of chemistry was called Alchemy and in it the 
       first Alchemist of chemistry. In alchemy came another type of knowledge-research phase. The Greek 
       word alchemy came from the Arabic word kinmi. From kinmi came the word Chemi, which was used in 
       ancient times. In the nineteenth century, the first modern chemistry educator reviewed various 
       characteristics of chemistry to understand their research, which naturally gave us in our time. 
       Slowly, all the people who could do the right work, from the scientific perspective among the 
       scientists, they were doing better work. For this, they started providing more knowledge to 
       scientists. From that time, people became more thoughtful towards science and technology. 
       In the eighteenth century in Europe, many more scientists in chemistry, physics, Robert Boyle, 
       Sir Francis Bacon, John Dalton, Henry Cavendish and more individuals through modern science and
        more technologists through chemistry and other scientific subjects were conceived through 
        experimental means. Raw mango has various types of oil acids like: citric acid, malic acid, 
        etc. present, so raw mango is sour. But when the mango ripens, chemical changes occur in 
        these acids creating natural and fructose. So ripe mango is sweet. Kerosene, natural gas, 
        wax—these have main component hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon is a compound of carbon and hydrogen. So when these burn, they react with oxygen in the air and create carbon dioxide, water, light, and heat. When excess hydrochloric acid accumulates in the stomach, there is acidity problem in the stomach. Antacid is two compounds aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide that neutralize acid. Where there is matter, there is chemistry. There are various gaseous substances in the atmosphere. Some chemical changes are ongoing in the atmosphere. For example, it can be said that oxygen in the air is undergoing oxidation change every moment. Not only the atmosphere, this change also happens at the bottom of the ocean. When life first happened on Earth, the Earth was not like this, the Earth was surrounded by gaseous elements. At that time there was no air. So there was no existence of life. Over billions of years, countless chemical changes have occurred. Atmosphere was created, water was created, thousands of kinds of substances were created, all these together presented the possibility for the living world on Earth. Various animals and plants of humans, from small microorganisms (like bacteria, algae, etc.) to large plants or animals, all are made with various kinds of chemical substances. Each body is a big chemical factory. Here, countless chemical reactions are happening every moment. And that's why we are alive. Again, with the progress of civilization, humans have created many substances by causing chemical reactions among various substances that are special materials for our use. Like fuel or after fuel, from this polished teeth, or covered skin with painted or used cosmetics which is the contribution of the factory. In this way, we have soap, toothpaste cream near the environment, this life related various kinds of materials to meet our needs in the field of fruit using fertilizer and pesticide for human use, diesel-and education transmission various substances that are being benefited by causing chemical reactions. It can be said that it will not go where the environment is familiar or in a small scope. 1.02 With the help of the table, some necessary fields of chemistry are given examples: Air, mainly oxygen, the air we take when we breathe, that air's oxygen reacts with food production inside the body to produce energy.
    Drinking water, various mineral salts with water, water participates in various chemical reactions in our body. It also works as a solvent for various substances in the body. Most of the body is water. Dissolved in various substances and nutrients in the body, it flows out of the body with the help of sweat. Besides water in drinking water, there are various types of mineral salts like-calcium, magnesium etc. metal salts, which are especially beneficial for our body.
    Fertilizer, calcium, magnesium, potassium, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, phosphorus, essential elements for plants. Paper, cellulose, the invention of paper is a unique contribution to human civilization. Plants like bamboo, sugarcane mostly have polymer cellulose. In paper factories, paper is made through various kinds of chemical reactions from all these. Science has various branches. Like- chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, environmental science, geology etc. There is a deep relationship between one branch of science and another branch. Other branches of science are dependent on chemistry, chemistry is also dependent on other branches. Below, the relationship of chemistry with various branches of science is explained with the help of a few examples:
    Relationship of chemistry with biology:
    Plants produce their living parts through photosynthesis process. Photosynthesis is basically a chemical reaction. Plants take carbon-dioxide and water from the air. With the help of protoplasm of sun's part present in green protection, this water and carbon dioxide react to produce necessary sugar or mineral. It produces protein, amino acid by eating various types of food in the body. Time creates chemical substances of the living world. All chemical substances of plant and animal world and various chemical reactions happening among them are discussed in biology. So biology and chemistry are interrelated.
    Relationship of chemistry with physics:
    Among the topics of physics are snow, electricity, various metallurgy etc. The heat used for electricity is the contribution of chemistry. Oil, gas which runs towards the production of energy for many men. Electricity production is dependent on physics. Heat from chemistry is a branch of chemistry whose various theories are basically established based on various theories of physics and era.
